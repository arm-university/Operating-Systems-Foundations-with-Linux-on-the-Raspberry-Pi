## About this Book
- Textbook by Wim Vanderbauwhede & Jeremy Singer
- An introduction to the foundations of modern operating systems with a focus on GNU/Linux as applied to Arm-based microcontrollers.

At the heart of any modern computer device sits the operating system and if the device is a smartphone, IoT node, data centre server or supercomputer, then this is very likely to be Linux.

This textbook provides a practical introduction to the foundations of modern operating systems, with a focus on GNU/Linux and the Arm platform. It explains operating systems theory and concepts but grounds them in practical use through illustrative examples of their implementation in GNU/Linux, as well as making the connection with the Arm hardware supporting the OS functionality. An ideal starting point if you want to learn about operating systems but keep a practical, real-world focus.

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.

Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This book may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.
